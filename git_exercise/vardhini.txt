Hello! My name is P. Sri Vardhini.
Currently I'm pursuing Bachelor of Engineering (BE) in AI & ML course, where I have completed 4 semesters out of 8 semesters in KG Reddy College of Engineering and Technology.
Here in this Scene Weaver project, I do work as back-end developer.
I am really impassioned to work on this project
I proudly do say that, I'm so much inspired by my professor, NAVEEN RAJA S.M ( Asst. Professor of AI & DS department in CBIT) who is so hard working and displays perfection in his work. He is even such a great motivator for me and always supports me, helps me with things.
So I really would love to be as motivated, consistant and be strong as my professor.
My hobbies include, Dancing; Playing; Listening to songs.
